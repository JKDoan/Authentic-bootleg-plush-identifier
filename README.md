An AI script that analyzes an user submitted image of a plush and determines if it's an official plush or an bootleg. The predictions are made of data sets consisting of images of plushies of the characters from Sanrio and San-X. Several additional scripts have also been made to automatically modify the images for a more reliable data set (removing backgrounds, objects, etc.).
